// Split GFP system for probing specific complex formation
@article{Huang2011,
abstract = {Several versions of split green fluorescent protein (GFP) fold and reconstitute fluorescence, as do many circular permutants, but little is known about the dependence of reconstitution on circular permutation. Explored here is the capacity of GFP to fold and reconstitute fluorescence from various truncated circular permutants, herein called "leave-one-outs" using a quantitative in vivo solubility assay and in vivo reconstitution of fluorescence. Twelve leave-one-out permutants are discussed, one for each of the 12 secondary structure elements. The results expand the outlook for the use of permuted split GFPs as specific and self-reporting gene encoded affinity reagents.},

	title = {A {Monte} {Carlo} approach for assessing the specificity of protein oligomers observed in nano-electrospray mass spectra},
	volume = {283},
	abstract = {Nano-electrospray mass spectrometry is an emerging approach for studying the architecture and dynamics of complex oligomeric proteins. The analysis of such species can, however, be hindered by 'non-specific' protein-protein associations which arise as a result of the electrospray method. To understand the formation of specific versus non-specific protein oligomers detected by mass spectrometry we have developed a simple and rapid computational approach. This Monte Carlo algorithm characterizes the occupancy of protein species in the last offspring droplets created by the nano-electrospray process. As such it enables us to assess whether oligomers detected in mass spectra reflect solution populations, or instead are the result of associations during droplet fission and evaporation. We have trained and validated this method on three model protein complexes which are not known to form higher order oligomers, and one which has a tendency to self-associate in solution in a concentration dependent manner. We have then compared predictions of droplet occupancy to abundances obtained from mass spectra for the tetrameric amyloid-related protein transthyretin, which can cause cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy in humans. Interestingly, when such comparisons were made for wild-type transthyretin we were able to observe a propensity for the protein to form specific oligomers larger than the tetramer. In contrast, the tendency for the leucine-55-proline variant to form such oligomers was considerably reduced. We contemplate the significance of these specific higher order wild-type oligomers, and absence of such species in the variant, on the pathway of amyloid formation in transthyretin. More generally this easy-to-implement computational approach promises to improve our ability to identify oligomers of biological significance within the mass spectra of heterogenous protein complexes.

// Unfolding / denaturing of charged proteins in the gas phase
@article{Jarrold1999,
abstract = {The internal energy distributions for melting aluminum cluster cations with 100, 101, 126, and 127 atoms have been investigated using multicollision induced dissociation. The experimental results can be best fit with a statistical thermodynamic model that incorporates only fully solidlike and fully liquidlike clusters so that the internal energy distributions become bimodal during melting. This result is consistent with computer simulations of small clusters, where rapid fluctuations between entirely solidlike and entirely liquidlike states occur during the phase change. To establish a bimodal internal energy distribution, the time between the melting and freezing transitions must be longer than the time required for equilibration of the energy distribution (which is estimated to be around 1-2 micros under our conditions). For Al(100)(+) and Al(101)(+), the results indicate that this criterion is largely met. However, for Al(126)(+) and Al(127)(+), it appears that the bimodal energy distributions are partly filled in, suggesting that either the time between the melting and freezing transitions is comparable to the equilibration time or that the system starts to switch to macroscopic behavior where the phase change occurs with the two phases in contact.},
